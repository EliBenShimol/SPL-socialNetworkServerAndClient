to run the code you need to write this commed:
for the server(there is an added file name filtered, it contains all the words that need to be filtered):

1.mvn clean
2.mvn compile

3. mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="bgu.spl.net.impl.BGSServer.ReactorMain" -Dexec.args="7777 5"

for the reactor server.

3.mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="bgu.spl.net.impl.BGSServer.TPCMain" -Dexec.args="7777"
for the TPC server.

for the client:
1.make clean
2.make
3.bin/BGSclient 127.0.0.1 7777

the program runs on the same computer, for each client you need to open another terminal.
